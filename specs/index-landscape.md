# Index landscape: what we built, what depends on what, and what we'd keep

Status: audit, 2026-10-10. Read-only survey of `cloud` @ `d84d9c64`, `gcs` @ `a79b93da`, `cw-s3` @ `0ba9ad72` and `m3` @ `ef17b432`. No live cloud state (GCS, R2, D1, KV, VMs) was queried; where a claim depends on it, the text says so. File refs are to `cloud` unless prefixed `gcs:`, `cw:` or `m3:`.

## Why this audit (Ryan's framing)

- We have effectively built a small database: several independent index structures, plus readers and a planner that choose among them.
- The worry: special cases hung off the indexes, text search especially, may be arbitrary and brittle ("whack-a-mole"). How much of it is principled?
- **Per-deployment tailoring is the tension.**
  - Disjoint index sets per deployment are harder to reason about and more brittle.
  - But fleets really differ: long hex runs are common in cw and rare in gcs, so one index set can't be optimal for both.
  - If we tailor, it should be **declarative**: index shape is a function of measured corpus properties, re-evaluated regularly. The result should be the same for a new fleet and a long-running one, with hysteresis ("activation energy") so expensive backfills don't thrash.
  - Not a self-driving database.
- **Preference order:**
  1. simple bespoke indexes that suffice;
  2. off-the-shelf components (D1, R2, Workers and parquet/SQLite have given the "60–80%");
  3. if general machinery is unavoidable, build it generally and reusably, filling a real gap in the ecosystem, not grown organically with fleet-specific special cases.
- A working stack is landing now. This is the moment to reassess and pay down debt: make it look like what we'd have built had we known the end state, without scars from abandoned approaches.

## Executive summary

- **The thresholds are principled; the structure is where the mole-holes are.**
  - V = R = 100K, row groups of 8K, `START_MAX_ROWS` / `START_MAX_HITS` and the 50M-row shard target are each derived from a measurement. K = 256 is the exception: no rationale was found.
  - No reader or builder holds a term list or a per-fleet branch. Heaviness always comes from index statistics.
  - The brittleness comes from elsewhere:
    - five independent liveness stacks inside the static index (light, catalog, drill, anchors, starts-with catalog);
    - two path stores with a per-date fallback between them;
    - eleven deployment flags whose settings drifted for historical reasons.
- **89 reader decision points**:

  | Class | Count |
  |---|---:|
  | (a) intrinsic limit, stated honestly | 17 |
  | (b) safety guard | 19 |
  | (c) capability skew across deployments or generations | 30 |
  | (d) legacy or transition path | 23 |

  The 53 points in (c) and (d) are the debt. Most of them disappear with one capability manifest per index plus three deletions (per-scan reads for store-held dates, v1 tiers, the query box).
- **Per-deployment differences:**
  - Two rest on measured corpus properties: the hex-run share, and whether owner labels exist.
  - Two are input availability (access logs on gcs only; dir-cache serves gcs's re-attribution).
  - The other ~10 are historical: rollout order, config drift, or which session built what.
- **Anchored search is not one folded index.**
  - `$` is implicit in the suffix shards.
  - `^` uses a real sentinel (`/` + name), but those rows live in a separate `names/` shard set.
  - Heavy anchored terms use three separate rollup families.
  - Interleaving `names/` into `sx/` is +6% rows and is free at a compaction. It would also give heavy `^q` below the root through the existing contains machinery.
- **The two append pipelines share about 380 lines of copy-pasted machinery.** The interval store still carries pairwise inside `publish`, which is the failure mode the static pipeline fixed in `5343fa32`. One runner removes ~250–350 LOC and fixes that.

## 1. Inventory: every index and tier built or served

Deployments: **gcs** = gcs.oa.dev, **cw** = cw-s3.oa.dev, **r2** = r2.rbw.sh demo, **m3** = the personal laptop deployment.

### 1.1 Per-scan path store

Layout: `<l2root>/index/<gen>/`, one generation per run (`gcs:job/run.sh:76-82`).
- gcs: l2root = `listing/<scan>`, on GCS.
- cw: `cw-l2/<scan>`, on GCS, copied to R2 (`cw:job/cw-run.sh:244`).
- r2: R2 `disk-tree-demo/listing/<date>`.
- m3: R2 `disk-tree/listing/<store>/<date>`.

Pointers and footers are in D1 (`index_schema`, `index_row_groups`). File names come from `indexKey` (`site/functions/_lib/index.ts:288-303`), which mirrors `INDEX_VARIANTS` (`cloud/src/dt_cloud/index_footer.py:533-560`).

### 1.2 Interval store (gcs only)

Data lives in `gs://oa-gcs-usage-dvx/interval-store/<gen>/`, served from R2 `oa-gcs-usage-index` under the same keys. The profile is `cloud/src/dt_cloud/interval_profiles/gcs.json`. gcs prod reads it: `PATH_STORE="intervals"`, `INTERVAL_STORE_GEN="2026-10-09b"` (`gcs:site/wrangler.toml:53-54`, commit `1db67e1a`; whether this is deployed was not checked). `specs/interval-store.md:173-178` still calls this opt-in, and `specs/interval-store-append-gcs.md` still says the append is off by default. Both are stale: the job defaults `INTERVAL_STORE_APPEND:-1` (`gcs:job/run.sh:418-438`).

**Totals: (a) 17, (b) 19, (c) 30, (d) 23 = 89.**

Reading the classes:
- (a) and (b) are healthy. Each limit is measured or structural, and the refusals name their reason.
- (c) splits into two kinds:
  - **Inputs that genuinely differ** (owners/ledger, access logs, label slices): about 8 points.
  - **What happened to be built where** (anchors, drill, over-time, age pyramid, search sidecars, extras, KV, iv store, indexed-only): about 22 points.
- Most of the second kind goes away once every deployment builds the same standard set, and the reader reads capabilities from one manifest instead of probing files.
- (d) is mostly two transitions that can end:
  - **v1 → v2**: points 34, 40–43, 50.
  - **Per-scan → interval store**: points 3, 22, 29, 32, 35, 45.
  - Plus the query box: points 10, 13–15.

## 3. Per-deployment differences

Code is identical across deployments. `git diff cloud...gcs` and `git diff cloud...cw-s3` touch only `job/`, `infra/`, `wrangler.toml`, `stores/*.tsx`, migrations and specs. So every difference below is config, job scripts, or what was built. Branch lag:
- `cw-s3` is 7 `cloud` commits behind: it lacks deferred carries, `coloPutsSettled` and the iv drilled views.
- `m3` merges `local` and is ~143 commits behind (merge-base `e1db595e`).

Stale text found along the way:
- `gcs:site/wrangler.toml:94` says HEAVY "stays dev-only", but `:107` sets it.
- `site/wrangler.example.toml:112`.
- `staticNames.ts:31` names `2026-10-09cw`.
- `interval-store.md:173-178` and `interval-store-append-gcs.md` still describe the store as opt-in and off.
- `api/path-index.ts:16-17` lists v1 wire names.
- `age-pyramid.ts:46`.
- `cw:job/cw-run.sh:222`.
- `gcs:infra/cf/README.md:45`.
- `done/index-extras.md` (`ck`).

## 4. Anchored search: what was built, versus a folded suffix index

**What exists** (`specs/anchored-search.md`):
- `sx/` holds every suffix of ≥ 3 characters of each lowercase basename (`static_names.py:405,662-673`). A basename has no `/`, so no `sx` key contains one.
- **`$` is already folded in.** Every suffix ends at the name's end, so `s == q` means "the name ends with `q`", with at most one row per version. `q$` reads `sx/` as-is: "the suffix shards already are the anchored roots file" (`search-extensions.md:151`).
- **`^` uses a real sentinel, stored apart.**
  - `names/` holds `'/' + name` for every version at depth ≥ 1, at any name length (`static_anchors.py:116`).
  - So `^q` is the range `/q…` and `^q$` is the key `/q`.
  - It is exactly the suffix that starts at the `/` of `parent/name`, in `sx`'s layout (`SX_SCHEMA`, sorted `(s, path, usr, vf)`, 8K-row groups, 3-character shard prefixes). But it is its own shard set.
- **Heavy anchored terms do not use the drill.** They have three more families:
  - `anchors/` `end` rollups (keyed on an exact suffix);
  - `exact` rollups (keyed on `/` + a name);
  - `anchors/start/`, a per-bucket starts-with catalog for heavy `^q` at the root only.
- Ryan's belief is half right. The sentinel is there, but it lives in a parallel structure, not interleaved in the shards.

**Q: Is `names/` just the sentinel suffix stored separately?** Yes, with one superset property: it includes 1–2 character names, which `sx/` (≥ 3 characters) omits. That is why `^q$` works from 1 character (`indexedOnly.ts:74`).

**Q: Could it be interleaved into `sx/`, and at what cost?**

| Aspect | Cost |
|---|---|
| Ordering | `/` (0x2F) sorts between `.` and `0`, so the `/…` keys form their own 3-character prefixes: the same shard planner, ~13 more shards |
| Rows / bytes | +798M rows on 13.2B (+6.0%), +7.5 GB on 135.7 GB (+5.5%); per scan about +1.7M rows (38–90 MB) |
| Read amplification | ~none: contains and `q$` reads never touch `/` keys (a static literal never holds `/`, `staticFilter.ts:45`); at most one shared boundary group |
| Build time | ~+6% on suffix-map/shards (33 + 14 min wall at 32 tasks, `architecture/static-name-search.md:127`), replacing today's 20-min one-task `names` stage |
| Real cost 1 | needs a new generation (~165 VM-h ≈ $35–40 plus ~$16 R2 egress, `search-extensions.md:39`). **Free at a compaction**, which rewrites the base anyway |
| Real cost 2 | every builder that walks `sx` would see `/` keys (census, members, answers, `chist`, `static_roots`). Either exclude them, or let them in deliberately (next row) |
| Upside if let in | the 2,788 heavy `/`-prefixes become catalog members with drill roots and rollups. That is **heavy `^q` below the root through the existing contains machinery**: today's gap, which declines `^step`/`^data` inside buckets (`anchored-search.md:170`). Cost: ~4.07B prefix-row pairs, "the size of the long drill" (≈ +$19 build, +~200 GB R2) |
| Semantic seam | the contains first-hit test (parent contains `q`) equals the anchored test only if the parent path is also `/`-prefixed. That is one predicate change, at bucket segments (`static_anchors.py:96-113`) |

The specs never considered interleaving; no text mentions a sentinel or interleaving. The separation followed from the anchors rule "per tier … new keys only" (`anchored-search.md:23`), which avoided a rebuild. It also let cw skip anchors through a profile flag.

The FM-index was rejected explicitly for R2: "sequential round trips on R2" (`architecture/static-name-search.md:378`), and counts are occurrences rather than distinct weighted documents (`short-query-index.md:240`). That rejection stands. What is proposed here is a suffix array with a sentinel, which is what `sx` already is.

**Q: Could the `end` / `exact` rollups merge with the drill?** Yes, cheaply.
- **Already shared:** `ROLLUP_SCHEMA`, `GroupFile` two-level indexes, `heavy_dirs` / `rollup_cells`, `DRILL_RULES.stack`. The term keys `q/` and `/q/` can't collide with contains literals.
- **What differs:**
  - Aliasing: the drill has it, anchors don't.
  - The first-hit predicate.
  - The scoped bound: `R + 4·Σrg` vs `R + 2·Σrg`, the "+2" being the extra key-run straddle.
  - Separate liveness markers and separate per-scan stages.
- **What merging buys:** `end`, `exact` and `start` become kinds beside `long` and `short` under `drill/`, with one marker and one tier-cut rule. That deletes reader points 59–62 and `AnchoredSource`'s parallel stack logic.
- **Cost:** re-indexing ~3.5M cells (MB-scale), and coupling the per-scan drill and anchors builds. That coupling is fine once every deployment builds both.
- The starts-with catalog (`/q` × bucket) and the contains catalog (`q` × bucket) have the same semantics in different layouts. With interleaving, the first subsumes the second.

**Recommendation.** At the gcs compaction, fold `names/` into `sx/` and let `/` keys through the catalog and drill. `end` / `exact` become drill kinds, and `anchors/start/` disappears into the catalog.
- One index (suffixes with a sentinel), one catalog, one drill, one liveness marker.
- Heavy `^q` works at every depth.
- The `^q`-specific bounds (`START_MAX_*`), `firstPaint` and `bucketsOnly + scopedBelow` all go.
- Marginal cost ≈ the heavy-`^q` drill (~$19 compute, ~200 GB R2 ≈ $3/month). If that is too much, interleave anyway and exclude `/` keys from the drill: still one shard set, with heavy `^q` kept at its current degradation.

## 5. The two append pipelines

| | Static names | Interval store |
|---|---|---|
| CLI | `static-names runs add [-c …] SCAN` (`static_runner.py:520-542`), `runs merge`, `runs carry` | `interval-store append [-c -n -P] SCAN` (`interval_append.py:849-876`) |
| Ordering | `pending_scans` (`static_runner.py:79-94`); exit 3 not-next (`:50`) | imports `pending_scans` (`:446`); `NOT_NEXT=3` redefined (`:66`) |
| Prepare | `static_append.py:535-555`; unconditional write | `interval_append.py:606-623`; adds a ts check and `if_generation_match=0` |
| Per-range append (Batch, 16 tasks / 256 ranges) | contiguous blocks (`static_append.py:571-604`) | balanced by open rows (`assign_ranges` `:262-277`) |
| Tier builds | shards ∥ catalog, then drill ∥ anchors (`static_runner.py:345-412`) | none: 5 sorts cut inside publish (`cut_run` `:208-219`) |
| Publish | local, seconds, level-0 only (`static_append.py:662-700`) | Batch, **inline pairwise carries** (`push_run` `:771`, `:789-807`) |
| Merges | deferred N-way, manifest revisions `.m<NNN>`, lease (`static_merge.py:81-102,235-263,392-427`) | inline. Level 5 only logged (`:810-811`). No lease, no revisions |
| R2 | separate Batch job, markers last, `r2-verify`, manifest last (`static_runner.py:414-436`; `static_names.py:1537-1600`) | second runnable of the publish task (`:516-528`), its own `r2_cmd` (`:818-846`); a third copy in `interval_store.py:802-833` |
| Verify | optional `-t` brute force | inline per range (count + Σ hash, `:119-128,183-186`) |
| Prune | `static_append.py:456-469` | `interval_append.py:626-652` (threaded) |
| Lost-state rebuild | `rebuild-state` (`static_append.py:733`) | none (`interval-store.md:185`) |
| Profile | `Profile` (`static_profile.py:21-94`), Python examples or JSON, `STATIC_NAMES_*` | JSON `interval_profiles/gcs.json`, mapped onto the same `Profile` (`:344-377`), `INTERVAL_STORE_*`. No cw profile |
| Measured | ≈ 76 min/scan, ≈ 63 min without carries; ≈ $0.53/day (`static-append.md:56,395`) | 19.4 min, ≈ $0.77/scan (`interval-store.md:367-384`) |

**Near-duplicates** (interval side ≈ 380 LOC, plus ~60 LOC of the triplicated R2 copy):
- `Runner` (`interval_append.py:408-511` vs `static_runner.py:213-369`);
- `gcs_runner`, `append_cmd`/`add_cmd`, the `job_spec`/`job_id`/`task_command` wrappers;
- `_gcs`/`_latest_manifest`/`_state`/`_scans_of`;
- `prepare`;
- `prune_plan`/`prune_state`;
- `manifest`/`missing_files`;
- the R2 copy/verify;
- TS `ivManifest` (`index.ts:567-586`) vs `latestManifest` (`staticRuns.ts:191-198`);
- ~150 test LOC.

Divergences that look accidental:
- The interval store resolves the newest manifest with a plain `sorted()`, with no `manifest_keys` filter (`interval_append.py:434-435,588-592`). It is correct for revisions only by lexical luck, and untested.
- Different poll intervals.
- Different prepare preconditions.

**One runner (`dt_cloud/runs/`).**

Generic core:
- `pending_scans`, `prepare` (with precondition and ts check);
- `Runner.one/run/stage/concurrently`, `BatchRunner`, `job_spec`;
- `publish_level0`;
- `plan_carries`, `merge_pending`, `publish_revision` and the lease;
- `r2_publish` (runs with markers last, verify, manifest);
- `prune(state_complete)`;
- one `Profile` loader keyed by prefix;
- one TS `latestManifest`.

Each index plugs in a `Pipeline`:
- `prefix` / `job_prefix`;
- `range_stage`, with or without balanced assignment;
- `state_complete`;
- `tier_stages` (static: shards ∥ catalog → drill ∥ anchors; interval: `cut`);
- `run_files`;
- `merge_build` (static `build_merged_run`; interval `merge_range` × k + `cut_run`);
- `merge_eligible` (drill parity);
- `r2_order`;
- `manifest_extra` (interval `stamps`);
- an optional `verify_stage`.

What it gives:
- **Net −250–350 Python LOC, −100–150 test LOC, −15 TS LOC** (estimates from line ranges, not a prototype).
- The interval store gets deferred N-way carries, a lease, the manifest filter and a path to `rebuild-state`.
- The static pipeline gets balanced ranges, threaded prune, and publish + R2 in one VM.
- **Urgency:** the interval store's pairwise inline carries grow as 2^level inside a 60-min job timeout.
  - Its level-1 publish already took 182 s.
  - Its base is `2026-10-09b`, with daily runs: an L3 carry falls around 10-17 and an L4 around 10-25.
  - Static fixed exactly this failure in `5343fa32`.
  - Compaction (L5) is unbuilt for the interval store. In the same framework it is `merge_build` over the base plus every run.

## 6. Recommendation

### 6.1 Target end state (what we'd build today)

One **standard index set**, built identically on every deployment. A component is absent only when its *input* is absent, never because of a tuning choice.

| Layer | Standard component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest artifact | per-scan `path` sort (v2) | input to the interval append; not served once the store holds every date |
| Tree / diff / series | **interval store**: `path`, `bysize` (+ `slices`, `slices-bytotal`, `slices-bysize-user` **iff** the corpus has labels) | one store answers any scan, so per-scan `bysize`, per-scan D1 footers and the over-time groups become unnecessary |
| Text search | **static names**: `sx/` with sentinel rows (`/name`), one catalog, one drill whose kinds include `end`/`exact`/`start` | hex rule on everywhere (below) |
| Age | an age histogram as a derived sort of the interval store, or not at all | decide once; today it is cw-only by accident |
| Read lens | `reads` / `last_read` **iff** access logs exist | input availability |
| Caches | colo + KV + isolate, as today, with one `CACHE_V` per deployment namespace (stop dev sharing prod KV) | — |
| Runner | one `runs/` framework for both stores: level-0 publish, deferred N-way carries, revisions, compaction as an L5 merge | — |
| Capability manifest | each generation's manifest lists the tiers and kinds each run carries, plus the build rules (hex rule, labels) | the reader reads it once instead of probing five `meta.json` markers; `/api/filter-caps` advertises from it |

**Tailoring, declaratively.** After the standard set, only three knobs remain:

| Knob | Rule | Evaluated | Hysteresis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hex-run rule | **on everywhere** with fixed `H=16, T=8`. On gcs it affects 1.1% of rows, so it costs nothing and drops a dimension. A switch would be a self-driving knob with no payoff | — | — |
| Label slices (`usr`) | build iff the share of non-empty `usr` in the census > 1% | at each base build or compaction | turn off only below 0.1% for two consecutive compactions |
| Access / read lens | build iff an access-log source is configured | at deploy (input config) | — |
| Light bound V / R, shard target, row group | fixed constants (measured, uniform) | — | — |

Census stats come from the census that every base build and compaction already runs (the hex share and the `usr` share are both sampled there, as in `cw-static-names.md:126`). A new fleet's first build and a long-running fleet's compaction compute the same function of the corpus, so they reach the same shape. Hysteresis is the compaction boundary itself: a rule changes only when a rebuild that is already paid for runs. That is the "activation energy", with no extra backfill. This is a profile computed from data at a fixed point, not a self-driving database.

### 6.2 Deletion list

| Drop | Payoff | When |
|---|---|---|
| `served/slices-bysize` in iv gen `2026-10-09b` (GCS + R2) | 33.5 GB stored; no code change | now |
| Static gen `2026-10-08` (uncoalesced) on R2 / GCS; cw `2026-10-09cw` | ~150.6 GB + ~118.7 GB R2 | now (verify no pointer) |
| iv gen `2026-10-09` (v3) and its `reads`-only path (`ivLastRead`, `view.ts:1404`; `reads` in `SORTS` / `R2_SERVED`) | reader point 29; one sort per cut | now; add an interval-gen GC to the runner |
| ClickHouse / serving box: `chstore/`, `box/`, `bench/` (~19.4K + 3.6K LOC), ~22.8K test LOC, `queryBox.ts`, `hotL1/L2`, `api/coarse.ts`, `/coarse` and `/hot` routes, `QUERY_BOX_*` vars, `ch-ingest` in `gcs:job/run.sh:458-470`, `job/ch-store*`, `infra/cf` `queryBoxHost` | reader points 10, 13–15; ≈ $710/mo (`ch-store-retirement.md`); the largest code mass in the repo | on Ryan's go (`ch-store-retirement.md:116-123`: tag `ch-store-final` first; keep `HotSearchForm` / `HotTotals` used by `NamePage.tsx:4`) |
| `FILTER_STATIC_HEAVY`, `FILTER_STATIC_ANCHORS`, `NAME_SUMMARY_STATIC`, `STATIC_BENCH`, `PATH_STORE=opt-in` / `?ps=iv`, `INTERVAL_STORE_REV` | reader points 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12; 6 env vars | now (each is set one way everywhere it exists) |
| `age.json` writer (`viz.py:544-574`), Phase A `age-index` code (`index.py:61-69,288-321`, `index.ts:291`), `over-time.scans.json`, gcs `claims` table | dead writes and dead code | now |
| `dirs`/`objects` references in gcs `GATE` mode (`gcs:job/run.sh:320-323`, `cascade-a2a`) | broken stale path | now |
| `.groups.json` blob fallback (`index.ts:823-846`) | reader point 32 (one of three modes) | once every live gen has `.groups.parquet` (check D1) |
| v1 reader (`toRowV1`, coarse tiers, v1 `user`, mixed diff, `scan-dirs-only`, `V1_FILTER_SCAN_OBJECTS`) | reader points 34, 40–43, 50 (~7) | when gcs v1 dates (pre-09-30) are re-cut as v2, or once the interval store holds them; ~100 v1 dates is a one-off recompress plus re-tier |
| Per-scan `bysize`, `bysize-user`, per-scan D1 footers and `index-gc` for interval-store deployments | ~13 GB/scan GCS (bysize), ~218 MB/scan D1; reader points 22, 35, 31 | after (i) scan existence moves to the store's `scans.json` (today `indexedScan` and `pathScans` read per-scan D1, `scanArg.ts:25-37`, `index.ts:361`) and (ii) search is off `perScan()` |
| Over-time groups (cw) | reader point 79, one cw stage | when cw has an interval store (series come from the store's versions) |
| Search sidecars (r2) | reader points 70–71 | if r2 gets the static index; otherwise keep as the small-corpus search (cheap, measured) |
| dir-cache | daily writes | keep while REPROC uses it; reassess with the interval store (attribution is a slice property) |
| `names/`, `anchors/` (end/exact/start) as separate families; `AnchoredSource`'s stack; `START_MAX_*`; `firstPaint` | reader points 59–63, 65; three builder stages | at the gcs compaction (§4) |
| Duplicated runner code | −250–350 Python LOC, −100–150 test LOC | before the iv counter reaches L3 (~10-17) |

### 6.3 Off-the-shelf check

| Tier | Candidates | Verdict and why | Cite |
|---|---|---|---|
| Path store / interval store | ClickHouse (self-hosted SCD-2), DuckDB on a box, MotherDuck, BigQuery, Aurora + `pg_trgm`, Cloud Run / GCE suspend, Iceberg/Hudi | **ClickHouse was tried and retired.** Warm 0.20/1.46/4.33 s, 105/105 exact, but ≈ $728/mo always-on and broad search never got interactive. It ended up serving only name search, which moved to static R2 (`ch-store-retirement.md:5,137`; `serving-options.md:301-377`; `ch-store.md:552`). Suspend/resume failed the 10 s gate (~30 s). BigQuery: on-demand pricing ruinous. Aurora: poor latency per dollar. Iceberg: vocabulary only. **Not evaluated:** R2 Data Catalog (managed Iceberg on R2) and R2 SQL. The interval store is effectively an SCD-2 table with footers in D1, the shape Iceberg standardizes, but no Worker-side Iceberg reader exists, and our pruning keys (dyadic levels, `b_min`, neighbour bounds) are beyond Iceberg's manifest stats. Worth a timeboxed look before generalizing (below) | `serving-options.md:142-191`; `done/storage.md:21-29` |
| Static names | SQLite FTS5 trigram (D1 or HTTP-VFS), FM-index, DuckDB-wasm, ClickHouse ngram/bloom | FTS5: "not bounded by the result; still needs postings". FM-index: sequential round trips on R2. ClickHouse ngram/bloom rejected inside the CH work. **Not evaluated:** Tantivy/Quickwit (object-storage search). Infix search there needs n-gram tokenization, the same postings-blowup FTS5 had, and Quickwit is a server, not a Worker reader. Suffix-ordered postings on R2 (ours) remain the right call | `architecture/static-name-search.md:375-378`; `clickhouse.md:80,112` |
| Footers / planner | parquet footers parsed in the Worker | rejected for size (86 MB/sort); D1 footers + `.groups.parquet` are ours | `path-store.md:93` |
| Caches | Cache API, KV | already off the shelf | — |
| Runner | GCP Batch + ours | Batch is off the shelf; the runner is ~1K LOC of scheduling/manifests. A workflow engine (Workflows, Dagster) would add a service without removing the manifest logic, which is the hard part | — |
| D1 / R2 / Workers | — | the substrate; keep | — |

**Is there a real ecosystem gap?** Yes, one: an *append-only, versioned (SCD-2), row-group-pruned parquet store on object storage, planned from a SQL-held footer and readable from an edge isolate under 128 MB*. Both stores are instances of it: interval store = versions of tree rows; static names = versions of suffix rows. If we generalize, extract exactly that:
- the `runs/` framework (counter, revisions, compaction, R2 publish);
- the footer-in-D1 / `.groups.parquet` planner;
- the colo-cached group reader.

Extract it as one library with both stores as clients. Everything fleet-specific stays out of it.

### 6.4 Sequencing

| When | Step |
|---|---|
| Now (no rebuild) | Delete `slices-bysize`, superseded generations, dead writers and code, stale `GATE` references, one-way flags. Fix stale docs. Decide `FILTER_INDEXED_ONLY` for cw (recommend on, matching gcs). Set cw D1 retention (`-r`). Stop gcs preview writing prod KV (own namespace or `CACHE_V` prefix). |
| Before ~10-17 (iv L3 carry) | ~~One runner; the interval store gets deferred N-way carries, the manifest filter~~ (done 2026-10-10, `append_runner`; live once gcs's job image is rebuilt) and an interval-gen GC (open). |
| On Ryan's go | Execute `ch-store-retirement.md`: VM, tunnel, timer, then the code deletion. |
| Before the gcs compaction | Move scan existence / scan lists (`indexedScan`, `pathScans`) to the store's `scans.json`. Write the capability manifest format. Land `static_compact` on `cloud` with `names/` folded into `sx/` and anchors as drill kinds (§4). Build interval-store compaction in the shared runner (adds the L4 floor, `interval-store.md:182`). |
| **gcs compaction (~2026-11-08, L5 of `2026-10-08c`)** | New static gen: hex rule on, `kind` bit (`search-extensions.md:261`, ~$15 marginal), split `path` (`static-append.md:417-421`), sentinel rows interleaved, unified catalog and drill. Readers switch via `STATIC_GEN`; the old gen stays until Ryan deletes it. Interval-store compaction the same week. |
| After the gcs compaction | Drop per-scan `bysize`, `bysize-user`, D1 footers and `index-gc` for gcs once v1 dates are re-cut or folded into the store. Remove the v1 reader. |
| cw | Profile `interval_profiles/cw.json` + the append in `cw-run.sh` (a 6-hourly cadence reaches L5 in 8 days, so the compaction matters sooner there). Enable the static per-scan append on prod (`STATIC_NAMES=1`, IAM decision in `cw-static-names.md:152-163`). Rebuild at cw's next compaction with the unified static format (gaining anchors). Then retire over-time groups, and fold the age pyramid into the store or drop it. |
| r2 / m3 | Small corpora: the per-scan store is adequate. Either adopt the standard set (cheap at their size, and it makes r2 the reference small deployment, recommended for r2) or freeze them as "per-scan only" with the per-scan reader kept as a supported mode. If both move, the per-scan reader becomes ingest-only. |

### 6.5 Top recommendations

1. ~~**One runner for both append pipelines, before the interval store's L3 carry (~10-17).**~~ **Done 2026-10-10** (`append_runner.py`; specs/static-append.md "One runner for both stores", specs/interval-store.md §2.7). The interval store has deferred N-way carries (a separate non-fatal `carry` job, revision manifests, the lease, resumable merges), the manifest name filter (Python and TS, one `newestManifest`), threaded prune shared; outputs byte-identical to the pairwise path on fixtures. Not done here: `rebuild-state` for the interval store, the static pipeline's balanced ranges and publish + R2 in one VM, an interval-generation GC.
2. **Fold anchored search into the base index at the ~11-08 compaction.**
   - `/`+name sentinel rows go into `sx/` (+6% rows, free at compaction).
   - `end`/`exact`/`start` become drill kinds and catalog rows.
   - One liveness marker. Heavy `^q` works at every depth.
3. **A standard index set everywhere, with tailoring only by input presence.**
   - Hex rule on everywhere (1.1% of gcs rows, so no switch is needed).
   - Labels built iff the census finds them, evaluated at compaction (the hysteresis).
   - A per-generation capability manifest replaces five `meta.json` probes and most of the 30 (c) branches.
4. **Finish the transitions, then delete.**
   - Move scan existence off per-scan D1.
   - Re-cut or fold the v1 dates.
   - Then remove the per-scan serving path for store-held deployments and the v1 reader (~13 (d) branches).
5. **Execute the ClickHouse retirement and the immediate deletions.**
   - The box code (~45K LOC with tests, ≈ $710/mo).
   - `slices-bysize` (33.5 GB), superseded static and iv generations (~270 GB R2).
   - Six one-way flags.
   - Dead writers: `age.json`, `age-index`, `over-time.scans.json`.

## Open questions and unverified claims

- Live state was not checked:
  - whether gcs prod is deployed with `PATH_STORE=intervals`;
  - whether the re-cut `bysize` pointers synced;
  - which D1 v1 coarse/`user` pointers remain;
  - whether the ClickHouse VM, tunnel and timer still run;
  - whether cw prod's KV is bound;
  - live R2 run stacks.
- The gcs 1.1% hex share is a sample over coalesced-version ranges, not a full census.
- The `?lens=user:x` latent 500 on cw/r2/m3 (reader point 82) was inferred from code.
- The LOC estimates in §5 are from line ranges, not a prototype.
- K = 256 has no recorded rationale.
