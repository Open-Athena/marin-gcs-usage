"""The static name index's hex-run rule (specs/static-hex-runs.md): interiors of long hex ids are not indexed.

On a lowercase string `l` (a name, or a parent path: `/` is not hex, so runs never cross a segment), a **hex run** is
a maximal substring of `[0-9a-f]` of at least `min` characters, `l[a..b]` (0-based, inclusive). A position `p` is
**inside** it iff `a < p ≤ b`; it is **opaque** iff also `p ≤ b − tail`, else it is in the run's **tail**.

- Suffix rows start at every position that is not opaque (the tail's included).
- A literal `q` **occurs** in `l` iff `l.find(q, p) == p` for some position `p` that is not inside a run, or that is in a
  run's tail and the occurrence extends past `b`.

Equivalently, with `before` = the hex characters just before `p` and `after` = those from `p` on, an occurrence of
length `m` at `p` is **dropped** iff `before ≥ 1 ∧ after ≥ 1 ∧ before + after ≥ min ∧ (after > tail ∨ m ≤ after)`.
That one test (`dropped`, `pos_ok_sql`) is what every builder, reader and brute force applies, so they agree exactly.

A rule of `None` is the full index (a generation built before the rule): `occurs` is plain `in`.
