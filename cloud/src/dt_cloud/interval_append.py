"""The interval store's per-scan append (specs/interval-store.md §2.7): each new scan becomes a small **run**
beside an immutable base generation, published by an immutable per-scan manifest, merged into bigger runs on a
binary counter, and read by combining base and runs (rows of one version: the smallest `vt` wins). The machinery is
`static_append`'s (the static name index's runs); the rows are the store's.

Per scan `D`, under `interval-store/<gen>/deltas/<D>/` (data bucket):

1. `prepare` (local): pin the next scan's `path` sort (`scans.json`), refusing any but the next.
2. `ranges` (key ranges, Batch): per range, the open versions (the previous scan's state, or the base's range files)
   and `D`'s rows → `pyrmts.intervals.append_intervals` for the three version tables the store serves:
   - `pvl`: one row per path, `last_read` in the key (`interval_store.fold`'s versions);
   - `sv`: owner slices (`build -S`);
   - `svt`: owner slices split where their path's version changes, with its total (`fold -S`).
   Each writes its delta (`pvl|sv|svt/r####.parquet`: opened versions, `op` 1, and close records — the closed
   version's row with its final `vt` — `op` −1) and the next open state (`state/<D>/…`, scratch bucket); the range's
   `ranges/r####.json` (its counts and reconstruction check) is written last.
3. `publish` (one task): cut the run's served sorts (`served/<sort>.parquet` + `.groups.parquet`, the five the
   Worker reads), its `meta.json`, then `manifests/<D>.json`: the newest earlier manifest's runs plus D's at level 0,
   written once and only after every file of every run it lists exists. No carries.
4. `r2` (as the R2 account): each listed run's served files → R2, checked there, then the manifest. A second runnable
   of the publish job's one task (one provisioning, not two), unless the R2 account is another service account; its
   own job when the manifest already exists (a rerun).
5. `prune` (local): every earlier scan's `state/` in the scratch bucket, once `D`'s is complete (parallel deletes).

Then, once after the scans, the **merge stage** (`append_runner`'s deferred carries, non-fatal): the binary counter's due
carries as one Batch job (`carry`: each merged run — per range `pyrmts.runs.merge_parquets` on its inputs' deltas, min-`vt`,
carries that chain folded into one N-way merge — then its own cut and `meta.json`; then a revision
`manifests/<id>.m<NNN>.json` of the newest manifest listing it), watched `-w` s; then R2 for the revision. The chain's
machinery (order, stage skipping, Batch, carries, lease, revisions, R2, prune, exit codes) is `append_runner`'s, shared
with the static name index; this module is the interval store's stages and merge.

The base+runs reconstruction is exact, version for version, with a full rebuild through `D`
(`test_interval_append.py`): the change keys are `build`'s, `wts` is carried as `build` and `fold` carry it (a
version opened by a read-day change alone keeps its path version's; a slice piece opened by its path's change
alone keeps its slice version's), and the open states carry each path's version start (`pvf`), where the
slice pieces split.
