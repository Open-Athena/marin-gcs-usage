"""Match roots of the heavy name terms (specs/architecture/static-name-search.md, "Drilldown"): for every
catalog member — the literals whose suffix range exceeds V rows, and every one- and two-character literal —
its first-hit rows themselves, so a filtered treemap / table / diff at any path P is computed from the
roots under P.

A **match root** of `q` is a first-hit row: a version (one owner slice of one path, live on `[vf, vt)`) at
depth ≥ 1 whose lowercase name contains `q` and whose lowercase parent path does not. The filtered view
at P on date D is the roots under P live on D, summed by child of P. (If P's own lowercase path contains
`q`, the whole subtree is covered by a root at or above P: the filtered view is the plain one.)

Long members' roots come from the suffix shards, level by level as the catalog's answers
(`static_catalog.member_events`), keeping the rows instead of summing them; short literals' from the
coalesced versions (`static_catalog.short_events`' rule). `measure` / `measure-short` count them:
per member its root rows and distinct root paths, and per directory the root rows under it
(bottom-up, one level at a time: a directory's totals are its children's).
