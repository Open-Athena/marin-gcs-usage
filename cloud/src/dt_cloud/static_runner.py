"""`dt-cloud static-names runs add SCAN_ID`: append one scan to the static name index as a run (specs/static-append.md),
in Python, so a deployment's scan job calls it directly (no `gcloud`: GCS and Batch over their APIs):

    prepare → append (key ranges on Batch) → shards ∥ catalog → [drill (long ∥ short)] ∥ [anchors] → publish (local:
      `manifests/<id>.json`, the run at level 0) → R2 (each run the manifest lists, its `drill/meta.json` last; then a check
      that every served file of those runs is on R2; then the manifest, last) [→ verify] → prune
    then, once after the scans: merge (the newest manifest's due carries, `static_merge`, one Batch job waited on up to
      `-w` s; then R2 for the revision it publishes) — non-fatal: the store is servable whatever becomes of it

The drill stage (the heavy-term drilldown, `static_drill`) runs when the profile says so (`drill`): one Batch job of two
tasks, `build -k task` (task 0 the long kind, task 1 the short; the second to finish writes `meta.json`). The anchors
stage (`static_anchors run`, the profile's `anchors`) reads none of the drill's output (nor the drill its), so the two
run at once; each keeps its own skip-if-done and post-check, and a failure of either fails the run once both end.

The unit is a scan: any deployment may scan once a day, every 6 h, or once more on demand, and each scan is its own
run (specs/scan-ids-not-dates.md). Scans are added **strictly in scan-id order**: given SCAN_ID, every published scan
after the generation's newest (base + live runs) and up to SCAN_ID is pending; the oldest pending must be SCAN_ID
itself, else it refuses (exit 3), or with `-c` catches up every pending scan in order. Each stage is skipped when its
output is in the data bucket, so a rerun resumes at the first missing one; the R2 copy skips objects already there,
so it always runs.

Exit status: 0 done, 3 not published yet or not the next scan, 1 a stage failed (the merge stage never fails the run).

The chain's machinery (order, stage skipping, Batch, the merge stage, exit codes) is `append_runner`'s, shared with the
interval store; this module is the static store's stage list and jobs.

Config: the deployment profile (`static_profile`: `STATIC_NAMES_PROFILE` = an example or a JSON file, then each
field's env var); a run needs its generation, buckets, layouts, region, image, accounts, R2 bucket and R2 secrets.
