"""Sweep executor — dry-run by default (specs/sweep-executor.md phase 3).

Consumes a `sweep manifest` plan dir. Per eligible directory: fresh re-list,
intersect with the manifest, verify the scan generation matches (falling back
to ``timeCreated`` for legacy scans), detect drift (new keys under a swept dir
→ skip the dir by default), and — only with ``--for-real`` — issue
generation-matched batch deletes.

Every decision lands in a per-bucket log parquet under the plan dir

    `deleted/<bucket>.parquet` logs (optionally only under `prefixes`,
    `gs://bucket/dir/` or bare `bucket/dir/`), via the GCS soft-delete
    restore of exactly the logged generation. `if_generation_match=0` makes it
    safe to re-run and safe against rewrites: a name that is live again is
    left alone (`already_live`), not clobbered. Per-object calls on a thread
    pool (restores aren't batched: a partial failure must be attributable per
    key). Writes `restored/<bucket>-<stamp>.parquet` + `undo-<stamp>-summary.json`
    beside the run's own logs; returns the summary. `deadline` (the run's
    `undo_deadline`) refuses a late undo up front — GCS would just answer 404
    per object, slowly.

    `bulk=True` restores whole directories with `objects.bulkRestore` instead,
    provably touching only logged objects:

    1. Logged rows are grouped by cover dir (`cover_dirs`: the outermost
       logged dir above each row's `dir`); each group's filter is
       `matchGlobs=[<dir>/**]`, `softDeleted{After,Before}Time` = the run's
       deletion window (`window`, else `deletion_window`; padded by
       `BULK_WINDOW_PAD` each side), `allowOverwrite=false`.
    2. Exactness precheck, per group: list every soft-deleted object under
       `<dir>/` (a prefix listing ⊇ what the glob can match), keep those whose
       `softDeleteTime` lies in the closed window (⊇ either reading of the
       bounds' inclusivity), and require each `(name, generation)` to be a
       wanted row of this run's log. The window ends in the past (≥
       `BULK_CLOCK_MARGIN` before `now`, else refused), and an object's
       `softDeleteTime` is fixed when it is deleted — so no object can *enter*
       the set "soft-deleted under `<dir>/` within the window" after the
       precheck; it can only leave it (hard-delete at retention, or a
       restore). The set the bulk op later acts on is therefore a subset of
       the set the precheck saw, all of it logged: the op can restore only
       logged objects. A group with any unlogged member (or a dir with glob
       metacharacters, or root-level rows) takes the per-object path whole.
    3. Passing groups are packed `globs_per_op` per operation, `bulk_ops`
       operations at a time, each polled to completion (counts in
       `restored/<bucket>-<stamp>-bulk.json`).
    4. Verification: live objects under each bulk dir are listed before and
       after; a logged name live after but not before is `bulk_restored`
       (its live generation as `new_generation`), live before is
       `already_live`, and anything still not live (op failed, skipped,
       outside the window — e.g. an earlier invocation's deletions in the
       same log dir) goes through the per-object restore, so every row ends
       with the same decisions the per-object path writes.

    A dry run with `bulk=True` runs the precheck (read-only listings) and logs
    `would_bulk_restore` / `would_restore` per row; it issues nothing."""
