"""The static name catalog (specs/architecture/static-name-search.md, "Static catalog"): precomputed
per-bucket first-hit answers, on every scan of a generation, for exactly the literals the static suffix
reader should not read itself, so no `/names` query needs the query box.

**Membership.** A literal `q` is a member iff

- it has one or two characters (every such literal present in any name, ever: the suffix shards hold
  suffixes of three or more characters only), or
- its range in the suffix shards — the suffix rows starting with `q`, i.e. Σ over versions of `q`'s
  occurrences in the version's lowercase name — holds more than `V` rows.

Ranges only grow as scans are appended (a version is never removed; a closure only sets its `vt`), so
membership is monotone: once a member, always one. A member's every prefix and every substring of three
or more characters is a member too (their ranges contain its range's rows, one for one), so the members
of a shard are found in one pass of its sorted suffixes, level by level (`census_sql`): the prefixes of
length `L` with more than `V` rows, then, among their rows only, those of length `L + 1`. Any `V` is
allowed; `census` keeps every prefix down to a lower floor so `V` can be chosen afterwards.

**Answers.** For a member and each scan date `D`, per bucket: Σ `size`, `n_files` over its first hits live
on `D` — the version is live (`vf ≤ D < vt`), at depth ≥ 1, its lowercase name contains `q` and its
lowercase parent path does not (`static_names.Reader.answer`, `mega_names.answer`). A version's rows in
`q`'s range are its occurrences of `q`; the first occurrence's row (`instr(name, q)` = the row's position)
carries it, so no dedup state is needed. Each first hit is two events — `+(size, n_files)` at `vf`,
`−(size, n_files)` at `vt` (none while open) — summed per `(q, bucket, t)` and accumulated in time order:
the cells are `(q, bucket, vf, b, o)`, one per change, as the ClickHouse catalog's `catalog_cells`. A
date's answer for a bucket is its newest cell at or before the date (none: zero).

**Layout** (`gs://oa-gcs-usage-dvx/static-names/<gen>/catalog/`, copied to R2): `cells.parquet`, sorted
`(q, bucket, vf)` in code-point order, `CELL_RG`-row groups, every member led by a header row `(q, '',
0, rows, n)` (`rows` = its range rows, −1 for a one- or two-character literal; `n` = its cells), so a
member with no first hits is still found; `index.parquet`, per row group `(rg, q_min, q_max, offset,
length, rows)` (the row group's exact first and last `q`, its byte span); `meta.json`.
